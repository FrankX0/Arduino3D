# Arduino3D

This is the source code for our series of articles published on 
The Hacking Den showing the construction of a 3D graphics pipeline that
runs on an Arduino.

This source code assumes you are using the Adafruit GFX library and a 
compatible display by Adafruit; it should be easy to change the underlying
library to another device.
